# The Hotshots Racing Dashboard!

This dashboard is part of a very fun stack of open-source software
created for the Official Wimpy’s World of Linux Gaming Most Official
Unofficial Hotshot Racing League Spring Championship (WWOLGMOUHRLSC)
competition that took place in early 2021. A group of friends from
Martin Wimpress’ **Wimpy’s World** discord channel who just so happen to
really enjoy racing games decided to have a little competition using the
retro-style racing game called Hotshot Racing. On top of the immense fun
we had, I thought it was a great time to collect our own real-time data
for each race and summarize it all with the power of R and Shiny!

The application is deployed here:
[rpodcast.shinyapps.io/hotshot\_dashboard](https://rpodcast.shinyapps.io/hotshot_dashboard/)

Want to see the replays of each grand prix session? All of the previous
sessions are available on Martin’s [YouTube
